This is a repisotory with different to-do list.
Indeed, the purpose is to train new frameworks with a simple to-do list.

Here how it is organised:
Master branch: Using React Only (without Redux, or hooks)
Redux Branch: Using React and Redux (with async actions to fetch all the todos in the DB), then the todos is used as a general state (ongoing).
Hooks Branch: Using React with hooks (soon).
