# TO DO LIST

The purpose of the to do list is to train to some technologies using this exercise. You will find the same to do list but with different methods or technologies, one for each branch as follow:

- master: Basic React
- Redux: Using React, React-Readux and Redux packages. All the states component used before are replace by Redux store mangement. Because it is a fullstack exercise, async actions are used to get all the todos from the back-end part.
- React-Hook: Using hooks in react to manipulate state.
